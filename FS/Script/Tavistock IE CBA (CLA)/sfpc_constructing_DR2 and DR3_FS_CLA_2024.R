# Script to construct DR2 data pre merging with DR3 CLA.

#Create a dataset which groups by child ID, arrange by referral dates,  
#only keep the first referral. Then create second column where you add 18 months to the referral date.
#Assign a number to the refdates. 1-10. And then you can arrange by the number of ref.
#A separate column with the number of referral next to the referral date. Then pivot wider, on that basis.
#Step 3-6 should be 1-3. Create referral order column. Then do the pivot. Do it all in a mutate statement. 
#Piping â€“ the pivot is dependent on creating the new column. Pipe the pivot within the table. Case 1 is multiple loops.
#Names from = columns, values from = referral date.
